# Factory Pattern

The Factory Pattern is used to abstract and encapsulate object creation.

It hides the logic of which subclass to instantiate, so client code depends on a common interface (`Product`) and not on specific implementations (`Sword`, `Axe`).

Common in:
- Notification systems
- Shape generators
- Business logic branching
